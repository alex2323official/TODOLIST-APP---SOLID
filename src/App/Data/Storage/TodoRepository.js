// TodoRepository (Storage / Persistence)

//     Handles data persistence. It saves the todos to a persistent storage (like localStorage, a database, or an API) and loads them when needed. It abstracts the details of how data is saved and retrieved, ensuring the business logic is decoupled from storage mechanisms.
